&lt;div id=&#34;quantiles-percentiles-and-quartiles&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quantiles, percentiles, and quartiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Descriptive statistics are a fundamental tools for a data analysis.
Their purpose is to describe and summarize data.
Quantitative variables such as weight, age, and income can be described by distributions (e.g., normal distribution) with measures of &lt;strong&gt;center&lt;/strong&gt; (the typical value of a variable) and &lt;strong&gt;variability&lt;/strong&gt; (spread around the center).
The mean is a measure of center.
The standard deviation is a measure of variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are special descriptive statistics that help us describe simultaneously center and spread of a variableâ€™s distribution.
These measures are often known as measures of &lt;strong&gt;positions&lt;/strong&gt;.
In general, they tell us the point of the distribution of a variable at which a given percentage of the data falls below or above that point.
The minimum and maximum values of a variable are measures of positions defining the point at which no data, or all data, fall below it, respectively.
The median is a measure of position that defines the point at which half of the data falls below it (and above it).
The median is a special case of the measure of position called &lt;strong&gt;percentile&lt;/strong&gt;.
The p-th percentile is the point such that p% of the observations fall below or at that point and (100 - p)% fall above it.
The 50-th percentile is the median.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quartiles&lt;/strong&gt; are commonly used percentiles.
The first quartile is the 25-th percentile, the value of the variable leaving to its left 25% of the distribution.
The third quartile is the 75-th percentile, the value of the variable leaving to its left 75% of the distribution.
You can think of quartiles as diving the probability distribution in 4 intervals with equal probabilities (e.g., area under the probability density function).
Similarly, you can think of percentiles as diving the probability distribution in 100 intervals with equal probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use the word &lt;strong&gt;quantile&lt;/strong&gt; to describe the general measure of position that divides the probability distribution in intervals with equal probabilities.
Percentiles divide the probability distribution of a variable in 100 intervals.
Deciles divide it in 10 intervals, and quartiles in four.
As such, percentiles, deciles, quartiles, and the median are all special cases of quantiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TL;DR, just give me the code!&lt;/h2&gt;

plot(density(age),
     main = &amp;quot;Quartiles for the probability distribution of age&amp;quot;,
     xlab = NA)

# Costum x ticks
axis(side = 1, at = c(27, round(quartiles, 1)), labels = TRUE)

# Add points for quantiles
points(c(quartiles, median(age)),
        y = rep(0, length(quartiles)+1))
points(c(quartiles, median(age)),
       y = dnorm(c(quartiles, median(age)), mean = mean(age), sd = sd(age)))

# Add segments to devide plot
segments(x0 = quartiles[1], y0 = 0,
         x1 = quartiles[1], y1 = dnorm(quartiles[1],

# Add percentage under the curve labels
